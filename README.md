# lostmagic2
My first game project, which will hopefully be a sequel to my favorite DS game, Lost Magic (which I am doing a [playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-ZQCxmPfkL_lLRjnz1FucJ0vbs9jFAJ) of).

The game will likely be for PC with mouse and keyboard controls

I have several ideas for new mechanics and features, such as adding more RPG elements and perhaps adding new magic, as well as making the controls a LOT friendlier than playing LM on DeSmuME

Keep watching this project. It might take a few months, but I'm doing it.
